# Kids Need More Sleep
This visual provides an easy to understand visual aid representing the hours of sleep that kids need versus the hours of sleep that kids average.  This could be used by school boards as they consider how they schedule the school hours of different age groups, or by parents as they consider what their child's 'bedtime' should be.  It is intended to very clearly display the results in a manner that could be easily interpreted by anyone, regardless of background or education.
The data shows the hours of sleep needed for each grade and the average hours of sleep for each grade in tabular form.  By adding in the visual aide, we are able to see that, across the board, every age group needs more sleep than they are able to get in their current circumstances.  This poses the question: Is this because of their schedule? Or their workload outside of school? Or is it neither? Is it just because parents don't know they need more? Maybe self-imposed by bedtime tantrums?  Regardless of the reason, this visual shows that more understanding is required.
